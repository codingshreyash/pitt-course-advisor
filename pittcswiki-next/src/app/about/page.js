            Information is power. We want to ensure that everyone has equal access
            to quality information they need to succeed. During our time at Pitt,
            we noticed most wisdom was just spread across individuals talking to
            other individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you did not happen to know the right people, you would be at a
            disadvantage. As students progress through college, everyone gains
            tidbits of knowledge that could be useful to future generations and
            have no good place to share it. We started compiling information into
            this Wiki to try to fix that. Each successive group of students should
            be better equipped than the last.
