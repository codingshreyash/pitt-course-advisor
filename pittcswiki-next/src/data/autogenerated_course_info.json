In this seminar course, we survey different types of personalization in educational technologies (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, social, motivational), computational modeling techniques for representing learners and their needs, and best practices in designing personalized supports for learners. Students will lead one or more class discussions, participate in the other discussions, and complete a group course project. \n\n",
